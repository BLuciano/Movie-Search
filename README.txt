This is a movie search application.
User will type in the title of a movie and all the information
regarding that movie will come up. 
Information such as year, cast, plot, director.

This app will use the http://www.omdbapi.com/ API 

For this application I wanted to experience working with APIs. I wanted to create a informational website about movies and chose the omdb API. 
During the process I was challenged with callbacks and asynchronous operations. As I got a better understanding how these items work together I was able to get my app to work as desired. 


*note, currently their image API is under testing sp images will not display. Soon I will add my default "no-image" poster to all searches until images go live.*
